Testkit is a testing execution environment, which is composed by testkit-manager and testkit-lite.
Testkit-manager represents a user interface front-end in browser, with a webUI interface.
It manages the auto tests execution remotely, and provides unified webUI to help the manual tests execution.

dependency:

perl-libxml-perl perl-App-cpanminus perl-XML-Simple


Installation:
===========
Step 1: install dependence packages on host
  Host (ubuntu11.10)
    sudo apt-get install libxml-simple-perl
    sudo apt-get install libdigest-sha-perl
    sudo apt-get install libjson-perl
    sudo apt-get install libio-pty-easy-perl
    sudo apt-get install cpanminus
    cpanm JSON
    sudo apt-get install rpm

  Host (fedora17)
    sudo yum install perl-libxml-perl
    sudo yum install perl-App-cpanminus
    sudo yum install perl-XML-Simple

Step 2: install testkit-manger on host
  Host (ubuntu11.10)
    rpm -ivh testkit-manager-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm --nodeps

  Host (fedora17)
    rpm -ivh testkit-manager-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm

Step 3: install 'sdb' on host
  sudo cp <somewhere>/sdb /usr/bin
  sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/sdb

Step 4: connect device
  power on device
  connect USB
  type command 'sdb devices' from the host to check if the device is really connected


Configure Repository of Test Packages:
========
Edit configuration file '/opt/testkit/manager/CONF' to configure the repo address
  This step is optional if you can access the default remote repo of test packages
  If you want to use the test packages offline, you need download test packages in your host, and put the package path to this configure file as local repo address


Startup:
===========
1. type command '/opt/testkit/manager/webapps/bin/testkit_start.pl' from the host
2. open web page on browser: http://<test-machine-name>:8899


Limitation:
===========
1. only support devices that have 'sdb' communication module
2. test result summary of total/pass/fail number on REPORT page is not accurate sometimes
3. can¡¯t run both core and web api test packages in one test run
4. when leave the execution page during test running, and then you go back, the page may not display profile info correctly
5. repo URL doesn't support whitespace and other special characters
