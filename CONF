#this the configuration file
#you can change some basic info for testkit-manager

#repository URL, currently we support two kinds of repos:
#remote HTTP repo and local repo
#if you want to specify a remote repo, you can follow the example below:
#repo_url_remote = http://xxx

repo_url_remote = http://xxx

#if you want to specify a local repo, you can follow the example below:
#repo_url_local = /home/package/

#please note that two kinds of repos can't be open at the same time
#if so, we'll only detect the first one.
#also the repo URL must be ended with "/", otherwise it won't recognize package name correctly
